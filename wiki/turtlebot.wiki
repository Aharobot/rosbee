#summary information about the turtlebot.

= Introduction =

We have used the Turtlebot package on two things, the first is the simulation during the time we didn’t had a robot at our disposal to use for testing our code. This package used gazebo for simulation of the Turtlebot, and the Turtlebot simulation files. It worked well but that was because the output information was more detailed than we had from the RosBee that we used before. The second package that we use is the main information about the Turtlebot itself. This contains all the drivers for the USA version of the Turtlebot. Because we have an EU version we need a bit more than only the normal package. 

With the use of both of these packages we could test and update our code to work properly while not having the RosBee available.



= installation =

The installation of the packages needed for the things we used consists out of 3 steps, installation of the laptop that is connected to the Turtlebot directly. The second is the installation on the desktop for the software to steer and visualize the output. And the final step it the installation of the simulation software, this one is last because it exist mostly of the packages used at step 2. 

*§ 2.1	Installation turtlebot laptop*

_2.1.1	Roomba/serial._
First thing we need to install are the roomba and serial communication stacks. 
The serial stack: 

Svn co http://isr-uc-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/stacks/serial_communication/trunk serial

This creates the map serial on its current location with the svn checkout of the link. When u open the map serial u use the command “make” to build the main files. Than u go into the map cereal_port and use the “make” command again.

The roomba stack: 

svn co http://isr-uc-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/stacks/roomba_robot/trunk roomba

this creates the map roomba on the current location with the svn checkout of the link. When u open the roomba map u give the command “make” to get the main build files. Then you go into the map roomba_500_series and do the command “make” again. This gives u the binary to run the communication program for communicating from the laptop to the roomba

_2.1.2	Turtlebot + ssh_

now we set up the main installation for the communication between the laptop and the roomba we can move on to getting the turtlebot files. to get the installation files u use the following command:

• Update apt repos 
sudo apt-get update
• Install SSH to allow remote connections and update your TurtleBot software 
`	sudo apt-get install ssh ros-electric-turtlebot-robot

the after u have don’t this u have installed the turtlebot files and the program ssh what gives u access to wireless communication.

 
_2.1.3	Chrony_

Now we need to install the last bit on the laptop and that is the chrony so that the communication doesn’t get timeouts because the system times are off.

• Install Chrony 
sudo apt-get install chrony
• manually sync NTP 
sudo ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com



*§ 2.2	Installation main pc*

_2.2.1	Checklist_

What u need to have on the main pc are the following things: 

-	A ROS installation of electric
-	An ogre installation for visualization
-	And be able to set up a network connection between both pc’s (ssh)

_2.2.2	Chrony_
Now we also need to install chrony on the main pc to make sure both are running on the same time so there are no timeouts because of time difference.
•  Install Chrony 
sudo apt-get install chrony
•  manually sync NTP 
sudo ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com

_2.2.3	Turtlebot + ssh_

The last step to get the pc ready for communication between the pc and the laptop is installing ssh and the turtlebot files. It are the same commands as used before.
• Update apt repos 
sudo apt-get update
• Install SSH to allow remote connections and update your TurtleBot software 
	sudo apt-get install ssh ros-electric-turtlebot-robot

 
*§ 2.3	Gazebo + Simulation turtlebot*
_2.3.1	Installation (requires root access)_

For more details on the installation check the following link: http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/doc/Gazebo-manual-svn-html/install.html 

The things we did to install the package are as followed:

$ tar xvzf gazebo-<version>.tar.gz
$ cd gazebo-<version>
$ scons

Note that scons will fail if any of the required packages are missing. Once Gazebo has been built, it can be installed: 

$ su
$ scons install
$ exit
Gazebo is now ready to run; try: 
	$ gazebo /usr/local/share/gazebo/worlds/pioneer.world

_2.3.2	Turtlebot simulation program_

With the 2 following command we can get all the packages we need to install the Turtlebot simulation that can run in gazebo.

sudo apt-get update 

sudo apt-get install ros-electric-turtlebot-simulator-desktop

this will take a few minutes but after its done it is fully installed and ready for usage.
